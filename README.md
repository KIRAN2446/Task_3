This Python project implements a basic chatbot that understands and responds to user queries using natural language processing techniques. It leverages NLTK for text preprocessing and scikit-learnâ€™s TF-IDF vectorizer to convert questions into numerical vectors. By calculating cosine similarity between user input and predefined questions, it finds the best matching response from a set of predefined answers. The chatbot handles casual greetings, jokes, and simple conversation flow with an interactive command-line interface.
